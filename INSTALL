Compilation: 
for Unix-like system users:
	cd /path/to/dolphin
	make image boot kernel 
	# if you want, you can write it to floppy:
	sudo dd if=dolphin.img of=/dev/fd0

for Windows users:
	1) compile kernel.asm with NASM with executable name KERNEL.BIN
	2) copy it into the root of floppy disk 
	3) compile bootloader (bfat12.asm) into BOOT.BIN 
	4) write BOOT.BIN to the first sector of a floppy (with rawwrite.exe 
		or whatever your Windoze's utility is);

then boot from this floppy and enjoy!
