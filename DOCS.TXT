			Welcome to DolphinOS!
					ver. 0.0.1
	
					"I'll build my own DOS! With blackjack 
					and hookers!"
						- slightly paraphrased Bender

		Introduction
	DolphinOS is tiny and simplest operating system for x86 platform. Written
for some assembler experience and lulz.
		
		Features: 
	- bootloader for FAT12 file system;
	- monolithic kernel written in ASM (NASM used);
	- simplest shell;
	- single-user, single-task 16bit operating system;
	- support for FAT12 (under development);
	- memory handler (testing);

		Agenda:
	- support for fat32/vfat, ext2, iso9660 file systems;
	- loading user programs in .com format (ELF and PE later);
	- basic text editor;
	- basic VC/MC-like file manager;
	- basic graphics support;
	- valid unix-like shell;
	- ??????
	- PROFIT!!!

		Kernel
		
		File systems
	File system hierarchy will be a single unix-like tree. There is a root, 
/, where traditional  unix directories  is located:  /bin, /dev, /home.  System
disk is mounted to /, another devices - to mount points table entries.
	
		Heap
	Heap begins behind the kernel and has its own segment, whenever referred 
to pointer allocated with memalloc, it means HEAP_SEG:pointer. 
	Heap segment is KERNEL_SEGM + kernel_end >> 4, adresses are 0x0000-0xffff
	Structure of heap:
	heap is build from chunks, each chunk contains header (4b) and arbitrary 
data after header:
	 <----- chunk 0 -------> <- 1 -> <----- chunk 2 ---> ...
	|----|------------------|----|--|----|--------------| ... |----|--|0000|
	  h1      data of h1      h2 data h3    data of h3          hN      end
	where h1, h2, h3 - headers of chunks
	Header structure is:
	|--------|--------|---------|---------|
	<-- data length -> <- Serv-> <- CSum ->
	where 	data length	- big-endian word, length of data after header
		Serv 		- service flags, this byte is 0, if chunk is free
		CSum 		- control sum,
			 == high[datalentgh] + low[datalength] + low[datapointer]
